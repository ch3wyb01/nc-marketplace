# Marketplace

Northcoders are creating an online marketplace where we can find new homes for all of the unused items we have lying around, rather than letting them go to waste or just throwing them out. Users will be able to list items they no longer want and other users can order them from each other. We have a lot of <s>old rubbish</s> retro antiques to get rid of so the items are all sorted into categories to make searching though them easier.

## How to run this app locally
### Clone the repo:
- `cd` into the directory where you would like the app to be stored
- clone the repo by using the command `git clone https://github.com/ch3wyb01/marketplace.git` in your terminal.
- `cd` into the newly created directory and then `cd` into the marketplace-app directory \
    e.g. `cd marketplace/marketplace-app`

#### *Once in the project directory:*

### Install dependencies:
- use the command `npm i` to install all dependencies.
